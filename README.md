# Federated Learning Framework

A modular PyTorch-based federated learning framework supporting:
- Model compression with error-feedback
- Non-IID data partitioning
- CNN / ViT / LLM model families
- Adjustable number of clients
- Communication bit accounting

Run:
```bash
python run.py --cfg configs/example.yaml
```
